                    <h3>Genre: Novel in Verse (Prose Poems)</h3>
                    <p>Display the first few pages of the novel. Explain that <i>Inside Out & Back Again</i> blends genres. It is a historical novel that tells a story set in Vietnam and Alabama in 1975, at the end of the Vietnam War. But unlike most novels, the story is written as a novel in verse, or a series of “prose poems” instead of chapters. Clarify that <i>prose</i> is ordinary writing, with complete sentences and paragraphs. Most novels are written in prose. <i>Poetry</i>, or <i>verse</i>, is unlike prose in that it is language arranged in lines and stanzas. In addition, poetry uses language to create specific effects through sound, rhythm, and imagery. Some poems have rhyme and a consistent rhythm, but some do not. <i>Inside Out & Back Again</i> is written in free verse prose poems, which are structured like poetry but do not have regular rhyme or rhythm.</p>
                    
                    <p>Display the first prose poem, “1975: Year of the Cat,” on pp. 1–3. Guide students to identify the features that are more characteristic of poetry (lines, line breaks, stanzas) and those that are more characteristic of prose (some sentences, usually no rhyme or rhythm). As students read, have them think about why the author chose to write a novel in verse for this story.
                    </p>
                    <h3><span>Imagery and Sensory Details </span></h3>
                    <p>Imagery includes any literal or figurative language that creates vivid pictures in the reader’s mind, including sensory details. Provide an example, such as “An old, angry knot expanded in my throat” from p. 2. Explain that the image of the “old, angry knot” expanding in Hà’s throat appeals to both sight and touch. In this case, the imagery is figurative. There isn’t a literal knot in her throat, but the image expresses the sensation of her throat tightening painfully as she gets upset.</p>
                    <p>Tell students to watch for examples of imagery throughout the text and to think about how the language helps them visualize the image or scene. Explain that writers often create images that work together to help develop an overall message. As students read, have them identify images and the senses they appeal to, and then analyze whether the images help develop a larger message.</p>

                    <h2 id="scrollTop_s3_1">Summary</h2>
                    <p>In 1975, Hà, the youngest in her family, turns 10. In Saigon, Hà delights in the tastes and smells of the Vietnamese markets, the familiar traditions of T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t, and the promising growth of her papaya tree in the backyard. She tolerates her three older brothers and admires her mother who is raising the family alone. Hà feels the heavy absence of her father, who was captured during a navy mission when she was only a baby. North Vietnam and South Vietnam have been at war longer than Hà has been alive, but by spring 1975, the fighting gets closer and the family’s—and country’s—future is in peril. Prices rise, friends leave Saigon, exploding bombs get closer, and Hà’s family must make plans to escape. Just before the Fall of Saigon, they board a crowded naval ship headed out to sea, toward the United States. Conditions on the ship are miserable, and Hà and her family are running out of food. After weeks at sea, the ship reaches Guam, and Hà’s mother decides they will resettle in the United States. The U.S. Government pays Americans to sponsor Vietnamese refugees who were forced to flee. When an Alabaman car salesman (“Our Cowboy”) shows interest in sponsoring Brother Quang, who studied engineering, Hà’s mother persuades him to take in the family of five.</p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>How is this year’s celebration of T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t like that of other years for Hà? How is this year’s T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t different for her? <i>(This year, Hà and her family follow the main T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t traditions, such as eating special foods and visiting the Teller of Fate. But this year Hà gets angry that “only male feet can bring good luck,” so she secretly taps her toe first. War makes T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t feel ominous this year: The Teller of Fate warns their lives “will twist inside out,” and there is a rumor the T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t food will be “smeared with blood.”) </i></li>
                        <li>How does Mother include Hà’s father in their family traditions, even though he isn’t with them in person? <i>(On pp. 12–13, Hà describes Mother preparing an altar for his return. The altar tradition suggests the family is still hopeful for his return and that he is still part of the family.)</i></li>
                       <li>How might sharing traditions as a group help people feel like they belong? <i>(Possible response: Traditions help people feel connected to and supported by others, including those from other generations and other places.)</i></li>
                       <li>Tell about a time when a shared tradition helped give you a sense of belonging. </li>

                    <p>In Alabama, the cement lanes and green lawns reveal a “clean, quiet loneliness,” so different from the bustling markets filled with the lively sights, sounds, and tastes of Saigon. Hà and her family try to eat American fried chicken and hot dogs, try to learn the rules and exceptions of English, and try to be grateful and fit in with their new neighbors, but it is hard to feel like they belong. At school, Hà is bullied for being different and feels “dumb” and discouraged as she struggles to communicate in English. However, a kind and patient neighbor, Mrs. Washington, helps her improve her English and navigate her new school and relationships. Like Hà’s mother, Mrs. Washington helps Hà gradually accept and adapt to her new home while finding strength and support in her family and Vietnamese traditions. Hà realizes that her brothers and mother also face prejudice, and their support helps her learn how to stand up for herself and rise above the ignorance and violence of others.</p>

                    <h3>What helps us feel like we belong?</h3>
                    <p>Draw students’ attention to the Before Reading activity and students’ responses regarding what helps them feel like they do—or do not—belong. Then have them reflect on the following prompts: </p>

                    <ul class="small-bullet">
                        <li>How do people help Hà feel like she belongs?</li>
                        <li>What makes her feel like she doesn’t belong, and how does she come to terms with that?</li>
                        <li>How does the story show how you might help someone else in a situation like Hà’s? </li>
                        <li>What strategies from Hà’s experience would you use if you had to start over in a new country?</li>
                        <li>How might adapting and combining traditions give people a deeper sense of belonging?</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Then have students think about the question more universally through the Mirrors & Windows and Project-Based Learning activities. </p>

                    <h3>What helps us feel like we belong?</h3>
                    <p>Students have reflected on how family and traditions help Hà feel like she belongs, including helping her adapt to her new life while strengthening and deepening her sense of self.  

                    </p>
                    <p>Now have them reread the statements from Before Reading. Have them think about how their thoughts have developed or changed after reading the story. Have them also consider how Hà might respond to these statements, at the beginning of the story and at the end.</p>
                    
                        <p><span class="bold">1.</span> When moving to a new place, people should do everything they can to fit in. </p>

                        <p><span class="bold">3.</span> Sharing traditions shows people that they belong.</p>
                        <p><span class="bold">4.</span> If people feel like they belong, they are more willing to embrace challenges.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Use the guiding questions to prompt discussion:</P>
                        <ul class="small-bullet">
                            <li>Has your response for any of the statements changed after reading the text? Why?</li>
                            <li>How did the story mirror your own experiences and/or help you better understand the experiences of others, such as refugees, immigrants, and people learning English as a second language? </li>
                            <li>In Alabama, Hà holds onto many familiar traditions while embracing some new traditions too. Have you or anyone you know combined traditions in a similar way? How might this help people gain a sense of belonging in a new place? </li>
                        </ul>

                                <p>
                                    In 1975 Saigon, Hà celebrates T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. She shops in the markets and tends her papaya tree. Hà lives with her three older brothers and her mother; her father was captured during a naval mission nine years ago. North and South Vietnam have been at war for years, but as Communist forces advance, Hà’s family must flee. They board a crowded naval ship as the Communists invade Saigon. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    At sea for weeks, Vietnamese refugees are packed together with little food or water. Finally, Hà’s ship reaches the United States. An Alabaman agrees to sponsor Brother Quang, but Hà’s mother persuades him to sponsor the entire family. 
                                </p>
                                In Alabama, Hà finds the people distant, the food bland, and English difficult. Hà is bullied and feels dumb when she can’t communicate. But her neighbor Mrs. Washington tutors her and, like Hà’s mother, helps her adapt to her new home. During the holidays, new friends share meals and gifts, and Hà finally starts to feel like she belongs. </p>
                                <p>When Hà’s family learns her father is truly gone, they find support in each other and familiar traditions. When T&#x1ebf;t arrives again, Hà takes comfort that “luck starts over every new year” (p. 254). </p>
                               
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Theme Overview </h2>
                                <p>
                                    <span class="bold">Belonging</span> A key theme in <i>Inside Out & Back Again</i> is <span class="bold"> belonging</span>. Hà and her family flee Vietnam and must start their lives over in Alabama. There, they face racism and bullying. Yet Hà’s family; her kind neighbor, Mrs. Washington; and her classmates, Pem (Pam) and Steven; help her navigate her new life and give her a sense of belonging.  
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Family and Traditions</span> Another important theme is <span class="bold"> the important role of family and traditions.</span> In Saigon, Hà and her family delight in traditions such as T<span style="font-size: 20px;">&#7871;</span>t. In Alabama, Hà’s mother maintains traditions as they mourn Hà’s father’s death, and Ha’s brothers provide strength and protection as Hà struggles to fit in. Family and traditions help Hà accept her new life, gain a sense of belonging, and strengthen her sense of self. As Hà and her new friends share both American and Vietnamese traditions, she feels—and helps others feel—welcome. </p>
                                <h2 tabindex="-1" class="aboutauthorHeader">Sensitivity Issues </h2>

                                <p><span class="bold">War Violence</span> The story takes place during the end of the Vietnam War. In Saigon, there is reference to the sound of distant gunfire and bombs exploding. In Alabama, Hà describes her teacher, Miss Scott, showing the class insensitive, graphic photographs from the war, including one of a “burned, naked girl running, crying down a dirt road” (p. 194)—presumably, the disturbing image of Phan Thi Kim Phúc after a napalm attack. In the story, this adds to the sense of being “othered” that Hà experiences. Due to the sensitive nature of such images, this lesson does not include the use of Vietnam War photography featuring children or violence.
                                </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Suicide References</span> After receiving news that South Vietnam no longer exists, a woman on the ship tries to throw herself overboard and a man tries to stab himself with a toothbrush. (p. 85)</p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Racial Bullying/Slurs </span> Hà’s family is the only Asian family in their new community. The story includes a character, Pink Boy, who pokes, chases, and makes fun of Hà for being different. Later he tries to fight her, but she dodges him, and Pink Boy gets hurt as he falls. Hà contemplates kicking him but doesn’t. Brother Vu has a similar experience in which someone calls him “Ching Chong” and trips him. He does a scissors kick but intentionally avoids kicking the other student. Neighbors vandalize the house where Hà’s family lives, including throwing eggs at the house, toilet-papering the trees, and throwing a brick through a window. </p>
                                <p><span class="bold">Religious References and Irreverence</span> Throughout the story, Hà’s family practices some traditional Vietnamese Buddhist rituals as they hope, pray, and mourn for their father, such as chanting and lighting incense. Hà’s mother checks “Christian” for religion on the sponsor application, attends Baptist mass with their sponsors, and has the whole family baptized. She says, “all beliefs are pretty much the same,” and arguably converts more for social acceptance than for religious reasons. Later classmates tease Hà about Buddhism, calling her “Boo-Da Girl.” She retaliates by yelling “Gee-sus” at them.</p>

                            <p>The Three-Step Interview activity asks students to reflect on their understanding of belonging, including what helps them feel like they belong and how they can help others feel a sense of belonging as well. Use this activity as a warm-up for exploring the theme in <i>Inside Out & Back Again</i>. </p>
                            <p><span class="bold">1. </span> Display or distribute the statements to students. Clarify any statements as needed and remind students that they’ll need to agree or disagree with each statement and explain why. Interviewers should take notes so they can share responses. Provide sentence frames such as: <i>I agree/disagree with this because</i> <span class="longl">___________</span> .</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">2. </span> Place students into groups of four. Assign each group member a letter (A, B, C, D).</p>
                            <p><span class="bold">3. </span> Have the groups of four complete the three-step interview as follows:</p>

                                <li>Step 3: Members of the group then share the information they learned from the person they interviewed.</li>

                            <p><span class="bold">4. </span> Give students time to interview and share responses in their groups. Then confer as a class. First, tally the number of <i>agrees</i> or <i>disagrees</i> for each statement. Then, have students share specific explanations from their group. Encourage a variety of explanations. If most students share a particular view, provide counterpoints to probe other perspectives. Finally, summarize the discussion.</p>
